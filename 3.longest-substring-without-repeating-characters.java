 * Testcase Example:  '"abcabcbb"'
 *
 * Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating
 * characters.
 *
 * Examples:
 *
 * Given "abcabcbb", the answer is "abc", which the length is 3.
 *
 * Given "bbbbb", the answer is "b", with the length of 1.
 *
 * Given "pwwkew", the answer is "wke", with the length of 3. Note that the
 * answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
